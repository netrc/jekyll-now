Wow. Never heard so much criticism of a Star Wars movie so quickly. It tooks months for the hate against Episode 1 to surface, and 2 and 3 were (relatively) warmly received as being better. Nevertheless, I also remember the harsh takes against "Return Of The Jedi" for it's creaky script ("What I told you was true, from a certain point of view") and apparent emphasis of marketing over believability (ewoks). The IMDB user reviews will no doubt be updated, but the day after the preview showing, some thirty or more 1 or 2 star reviews (out of *10!*) were posted - [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/reviews)

IMHO - it's ok to like TLJ, and it's ok to hate it. I guess I have some experience with this as I am not a prequel-hater and so have to endure pitying remarks and blank stares when mentioning all the good stuff in TROS, AOTC, and yes, TPM.  (Apologies but I'll be using galactic standard movie abbreviations herein: TPM, AOTC, ROTS, ANH, TESB, ROTJ, R1, TFA, TLJ, SOLO, and EIX for the next episode (see [http://www.swbookzone.com/glossary.html](glossary) ).

**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**


For me, the first viewing was pretty overwhelming, so much stuff crammed into the movie which was already 2-1/2 hours long. And with the ending of Luke's physical story along with knowing that Carrie Fisher would not be returning, it was all pretty sad. After reading various posts, mostly negative, and after two more viewings, I'll say that the better parts of the film far outweigh the bad, and it's gets a lot easier to forgive the bad stuff.

Some have criticized Luke's behavior, but having young, innocent farmboy turn in to grumpy old man doesn't seem like a stretch to me. The main character arc seems to have been in mind since TFA (we see Luke watching his new temple burn down in Ray's vision). So, after a failure that enabled Ben to become Kylo, makes sense to have him get a little depressed and hide somewhere. If fans were expecting Luke -- as he says -- to recover his cheery disposition and fight the bad guys at the end of TLJ like the old days, that's a little naive. Luke's sacrifice makes sense, and certainly done in a novel and dramatic fashion.

The problem of course, is that we're left with a gaping hole in how to handle Episode 9. About which it seems that JJ Abrams can either straighten out the plotting of TLJ, or we'll hate EIX even more.

The odd thing about TLJ is the decision to subvert fan expectations - why, exactly? Disney/Lucasfilm goes to all the trouble of making the first new episode (TFA) a practical copy of ANH, with all the stock characters and the Falcon, and made $2 billion (and more). Now they bring in a new director/writer whose job it is to say, No, we actually don't want to answer questions or follow on with Star Wars conventions. If they wanted to go their own way, they should have done that with TFA. Pretty odd to set up expectations that this trilogy will be like the old days just to say, ha, fooled you and your simple preconceptions.

At the risk of falling to the dark side, for simplicity's sake, I'll just ascribe most of the bad plotting decisions to the new director - no need for Snoke backstory, no reveal of Rey's parents, and let's add a meaningless sub-plot excursion to a weird cantina - I mean casino - bringing in some current political points of sticking it to the 1%. Ye gods was that heavy-handed crap. (And missed out on connecting with the prequels nice nod to "Dune"-like banking clan and techno-union in AOTC). And not to keep bashing the casino, but it didn't even look-and-feel much like Star Wars. 

The main throne room showdown was great and, especially on subsequent viewings, I'm not too worried about the lack of explanation about Snoke. Still, can't see the point in not mentioning even with one sentence something about his rise to power. I presume and hope against hope that Kylo's jab at Rey - you're nothing, you have no part in this story - is just a lie. It's not a problem if Rey's parents or backstory isn't Dickensian coincidentalist (Oh, Plo Koon/Dooku/Uncle Owen happened to have an illegitimate child....). But there better be a story there. Again, this is basic Star Wars mythology, and meanwhile, we're paying lots of money for tickets to be told a story, so figure out some sort of story!

In summary, seeing the film again (and again) makes it much easier to skip over these lapses and hope for some plot cohesiveness in EIX. Seems to be our lot in life with so many episodic franchises to hope against hope that we'll get some satisfying resolution to myriad plot points in the final episode. I'm not even sure of any original tv or film franchise that managed this well. Granted it's tough to balance fresh takes with keeping true to the spirit, but I'll be damned disappointed if we end up with no Jedi's or even "grey" Jedi's at the end.

The lack of an overarching vision may be a problem with the current corporate structure. A recent note on  mentioned that JJ Abrams [https://www.starwarsnewsnet.com/2017/12/j-j-abrams-revealed-his-star-wars-episode-ix-pitch-to-bob-iger-today.html](pitched his script to Disney).  Yikes - except for ANH, Lucas never pitched his ideas to anyone; they were, effectively, the highest budget (and highest grossing) independent films by a couple orders of magnitude.

Solo - May 24th. Going to be very strange........ Back in the day, we had to wait three years...
JJ pitch to Iger - Sort of the problem here. Lucas pitched A New Hope to Fox; after that no pitches. Now directors have to impress others with the pitch.

Random points.....

[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/reference](Solo: A Star Wars Story) - It's going to be interesting to see how this fares at the box office coming so soon after TLJ: it opens just five months from now. Even I have my limits to Star Wars immersion. 

Kylo - Loving Adam Driver's work. Did you notice his mention of 'force projection' to Rey on their second 'connection' - "You're not doing this, the effort would kill you", which effort does kill Luke at the end.

Casino - 'Nuff said. But note there's a small John Williams music cue from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkKHp4nOU3E](The Long Goodbye) in the scene. And also a riff on the brilliant 1927 [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018578/reference](Wings) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1H699088FI](party scene).

Porgs - No problems here. From the trailer, I think we were all worried they'd be Chewie's new sidekick or something. But they're just set decoration, not a character or plot point (so far). Fine to have them around as the 'tribbles' of the Falcon. And the island Caretakers were fun.

Phasma's death - I can understand those that thought Phasma got short shrift, but honestly the character got a lot better treatment than Boba Fett did in ROTJ -  Phasma had a real fight and we even got a glimpse of the character  and the character's fear.

Poe - Oscar Isaac really shined as the blow-something-up flyboy. Also nice to see great pilot skills which were never really shown in the previous trilogies.

Finn - Joh Boyega shows lots of charm but Finn does almost nothing of importance in the film. I'd guess that that's why they threw in another waste of time moment with his thwarted sacrifice. Just plain dumb turning that moment in to a flirtation and yet another script subversion, "we win not by fighting what we hate but by saving what we love" - nice sentiment, but the movie is called Star *Wars*.

Droids - missing the droids. I love the original conception, droids in desert, very little dialogue. Hidden Fortress. Oh well.


Kids ending - nice scene. But lousy ending to star wars. Wonder why 7 and 8 couldn't have 'correct' ending. Wonder if 9 will.

Interesting takes:
medium - don't want to see GoT in space.

Luke's ending - seriously, given Carrie's death, don't know why you just don't swap out the death's. Leia's sacrifice jolts Luke to come back; Luke comes back and reluctantly takes on the mantle. 

Leia 'skywalking' - silly but very happy. My take: She was knocked unconscious, woke up, and Force'd herself back. Almost makes sense but emotionally very satisfying. And, in a way, important to finally show that the other Skywalker twin did indeed have some strong force powers. Many of us have been waiting to see Leia's special Force powers for 30-some years.

Multiple silent moments - Loved the hyperspace bombing of the First Order Fleet, but of course, why couldn't that have been autopiloted, or done by Ackbar or Leia. The "silent" treatment works great, though diminished because Johnson used it throughout the movie.

The lack of lightspeed jump - pretty ridiculous and really should have had some other techno-babble explanation. It was bad enough in A New Hope, but only lasted 10 minutes or so. Here they actually say it'll take dozens (30?) of hours. 

Music - didn't hear much new here. Of course, the original Empire score blew the doors off of the already fantastic Star Wars music with The Imperial March. Too bad. 

BTW, not sure why new Chewie is thinner and more well groomed that 'real' Chewie. And the new guy doesn't have the jerky quirkieness of the great Peter Mayhew.
