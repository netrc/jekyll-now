## Cpt. Campbell and the 17th Aero Squadron

I've finally completed scanning and transcribing my grandfathers diary and a few letters. They're all available at [http://www.richardcampbell.com/jdiary/](http://www.richardcampbell.com/jdiary/)

Not quite definitive, I'm still tracking down some names and other info, but I think that the map I've included in interesting, showing the airfields and areas of combat that Jesse writes about. Very interesting to compare and contrast with other diaries out there - see the Notes section for other info.
