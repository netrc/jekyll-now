title: Must See Movies ofthe '80s
---
Out with the gang a couple nights ago, rambling on about good movies, I mentioned ["Body Heat"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082089/combined)
as a must see and got blank stares from
the rest of the table. One asked sarcastically if it was in black and white. SMH as they say. At that point I was challenged to put
my list of such films in to IMDB. So... [MustSee Movies of the '80s](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls020038897/)

No real order or importance to the list, I mostly stayed away from the top money-makers that you'll have seen. And I didn't go too far
in to foreign films. As such the sweet spot on my list of 30-some films happens to be Woody Allen, with three films.
