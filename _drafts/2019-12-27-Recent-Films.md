## Ford Vs. Ferrari

Some of the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time, a long time. Bigger than life and action packed, the story of how Ford and Carrol Shelby took on Ferrari at the 1966 Le Mans is terrific. Affecting performances all around, with Christian Bale once again just taking over the movie. As always, lots of quibbles about the actual story (see below) but still more fun than expected. 

## The 24-Hour War

On Netflix, this documentary on the Ford Vs. Ferrari story is much more subdued than the film but earnestly presented. Fleshes out many of the other minor characters seen in the film and also gives credit where it is due to Ford Motor Co. itself - no Shelby didn't build the car all by himself. More importantly, it gives the backstory to Shelby and gives much more insight into the legendary driver/builder (Matt Damon's Shelby is much more polished and business-like than reality). 

## Midway

An astonishingly complete story of the first act of the naval battles of World War II. Including a brief prologue in Tokyo from the late '30s, this covers the strategy and tactics of the main battles from Pearl Harbor, the Doolittle Raid, to Coral Sea, and the Battle of Miday -- a period of just over 6 months. Amazing how the film honors each of those events and how they were connected. A great example: The film deftly shows how the U.S. submarine Nautilus was used in Midway, how the Japanese navy tried to depth charge bomb it, how the last Japanese ship had to steam full-speed back to their fleet, and how that ship's course helped guide U.S. pilots to the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers. 
Unlike many other films, there's no awkwardness when showing wives and family at home nor any contrived love story; the stars of the film are the main combatants, pilots, seamen, code-breakers, and ships.
