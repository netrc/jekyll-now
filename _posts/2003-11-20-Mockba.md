### Mockba

Visited Moscow for business Nov 14 - 18. Fascinating, odd place to be.  
Lots of construction downtown; many new (expensive) restaurants and shops;  
extravagent and bizarre casinos; along with the same grimy, broken down older
buildings and courtyards.  

Visited the [Tretyakov Gallery ](http://www.museum.ru/tretyakov/), the
Kremlin, and finally got in to see Lenin, still dead after all these years.  
(More info than you may want on the
[mausoleum](http://www.lenin.ru/mas_e.htm).)
