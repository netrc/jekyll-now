### Choices...Architects

Interviewed three architects this week

  * Chris - mainly drawings, expiditing 
  * Rob - one-man shop, design work, whatever. Nice guy. 
  * Michael - medium-sized shop, does soup-to-nuts, expensive design work if needed, otherwise an assembly line for people combining NYC apartments 

Rob and Michael are the choices. The first would be more fun and individual;
the second would be very quick, precise, and knows a bit more about dealing
with NYC.

Hmmmmmm.
