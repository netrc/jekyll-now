## From a different point of view

Over the past year or so, I've noticed a couple of pairs of films that seem made for each other, or rather that dove-tailed so perfectly that the pair together made for a much stronger overall story.

When [Dunkirk](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/) was released, the criticism was that it was not historical enough, didn't have any Germans or military strategy, and didn't even include Churchill. All true - but missing the point of Nolan's vision for a sensory immersion into the evacuation combined with his trademark "inception" of three different timelines and stories.  Then, miraculously, some few months later, [Darkest Hour] was released which filled in all the gaps: the political backstory in parliament, the military maneuvering, besides, of course, Churchill himself with Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning and scenery-chewing performance. 

The great thing about these two films is how well they complement each other. In Dunkirk, there is effectively only the war itself (on beach, sea, and air); in Darkest Hour, there are just the political offices (the commons, 10 Downing Street, the war cabinet).  Where the first has archetypical characters, visceral action, and little dialogue, the latter has complex character motivations, Machiavellian maneuvering, and critical debates. 

Later, I saw [First Man] and then [Apollo 11]. The Neil Armstrong bio-pic was nicely told, though tightly compressed, and while Gosling (and the script) did little to energize Armstrongs alkjfjflaffj and jumped from moment to moment with thundering effects. ending fictional. Now, you can't complain about a biography that focuses on one person; But with Apollo 11, you see everything but any one person. As if in response (though both films were long in development), the documentary seems almost to show everyone who worked on the mission - shot after shot of workers, technicians, assistants, and long tracking shots of various mission controllers working (and smoking!) at their CRTs. 

There are lots of examples of these twin movies. Wikipedia has a page listing a kind of twin... two or more movies released in the same year (or so) that treat the same subject. But most of these films are marketing grabs. Capote and Fabulous tell the same story though with much different tone (and success); adf afddf afdadfda. 

What interests me here are what I'll call "Parallax" movies. (Yes, after the movie). These are two movies - not necessarily released near each other in time - that deal with the same subject, mostly historical, but from widely different perspectives. In geometry, parralax is the apparent difference in viewpoint of one subject from two different vantages; In astronomy, the different sightings of stars from two different points in earth's orbit help to determine distance scales of the galaxy. 

Parallax films do the same, they can show 

Showing the same story from different viewpoints is a trope of fiction and film. Rashoman is perhaps the quintessential movie of this type. adsfafd. But this is a deliberate creation from one writer/director, not the coincidental release of different studios.
