Wow. Never heard so much criticism of a Star Wars movie so quickly. It tooks months for the hate against Episode 1 to surface, and 2 and 3 were (relatively) warmly received as being better. Nevertheless, I remember quite well the harsh takes against "Return Of The Jedi" for it's creaky script ("What I told you was true, from a certain point of view") and apparent emphasis of marketing over believability (ewoks). The IMDB user reviews will no doubt be updated, but the day after the preview showing, some thirty or more 1 or 2 star reviews (out of *10!*) were posted - [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/reviews)

For me, the episode was pretty overwhelming. 

So, taking all this in to account,  

**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**

Phasma's death - better than how Boba Fett was treated. Phasma had a real fight and we even got a glimpse of the character  and the character's fear.
