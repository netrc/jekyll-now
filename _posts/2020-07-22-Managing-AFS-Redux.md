## Everything old is new again....

You may know that decades ago I worked on AFS -- the Andrew File System -- while at the Center for Information Technology Integration office at The University of Michigan. I later introduced AFS to Morgan Stanley and thereafter wrote "Managing AFS" the book for Prentice-Hall, published in 1998.

I recently was able to get a 'reversion of rights' to the book and have now put the text up at [https://netrc.github.io/ManagingAFS/](https://netrc.github.io/ManagingAFS/) . All of the original source, etc, is at [https://github.com/netrc/ManagingAFS](https://netrc.github.com/netrc/ManagingAFS) .
