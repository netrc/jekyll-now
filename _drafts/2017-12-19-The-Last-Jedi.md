Wow. Never heard so much criticism of a Star Wars movie so quickly. It tooks months for the hate against Episode 1 to surface, and 2 and 3 were (relatively) warmly received as being better. Nevertheless, I remember quite well the harsh takes against "Return Of The Jedi" for it's creaky script ("What I told you was true, from a certain point of view") and apparent emphasis of marketing over believability (ewoks). The IMDB user reviews will no doubt be updated, but the day after the preview showing, some thirty or more 1 or 2 star reviews (out of *10!*) were posted - [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/reviews](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/reviews)

**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**



For me, the episode was pretty overwhelming, so much stuff crammed into the movie which was already 2-1/2 hours long. And with the ending of Luke's physical story along with knowing that Carrie Fisher would not be returning, it was all pretty sad. 

Worst way to put it - much of the script decisions seemed to be based on how to subvert the fans expectations. OK, that's one way to go. No, I don't want a completely self-serving plot

Random points.....

Casino - pretty much a waste of time. Note Williams music cue, and an homage to Wings. Oddly, didn't feel like the set or characters felt like Star Wars at all. And while the politics of the prequels was, in my opinion, purposefully adolescent, the "1%" attitudes were more intrusive here. At least I'd have liked to work in a reference to the Banking Clan as set up in the prequels.

Porgs - No problem. From the trailer, I think we were all worried they'd be Chewie's new sidekick or something. But they're just set decoration, not a character or plot point (so far). Fine to have them around as the 'tribbles' of the Falcon.

Phasma's death - better than how Boba Fett was treated. Phasma had a real fight and we even got a glimpse of the character  and the character's fear.

Poe - great. Note also nice to see great pilot skills.

Finn - nice but agree with others that his character does almost nothing in the film. And the Finn/Rose flirtation is dumb.

Droids - missing the droids. I love the original conception, droids in desert, very little dialogue. Hidden Fortress. Oh well.

Solo - May 24th. Going to be very strange........ Back in the day, we had to wait three years...

JJ pitch to Iger - Sort of the problem here. Lucas pitched A New Hope to Fox; after that no pitches. Now directors have to impress others with the pitch.

Kids ending - nice scene. But lousy ending to star wars. Wonder why 7 and 8 couldn't have 'correct' ending. Wonder if 9 will.

Interesting takes:
medium - don't want to see GoT in space.

Luke's ending - seriously, given Carrie's death, don't know why you just don't swap out the death's. Leia's sacrifice jolts Luke to come back; Luke comes back and reluctantly takes on the mantle. 

Leia 'skywalking' - silly but very happy. My take: She was knocked unconscious, woke up, and force'd herself back. Almost makes sense. But emotionally very satisfying. And, in a way, important to finally show that the other Skywalker twin did indeed have some strong force powers.

Snoke backstory - One thing to not care about Phasma backstory, but Snoke? Serkis and CGI were great. Now what? Wonderful move to subvert the expectations, but couldn't we have some sort of backstory?

Ending battle - one reason the movie feels long is that after the Casino gambit and rebels escaping, we get down to the planet and then start up yet another battle.  Lucas would have had the battle on Crait intercut with the space battle (for whatever technical/tactial reasons).  Johnson probably decides not to because that would be too on point - got to subvert expectations.

Multiple silent moments - Loved the hyperspace bombing of the First Order Fleet, but of course, why couldn't that have been autopiloted, or done by Ackbar or Leia. The "silent" treatment works great, though diminished because Johnson used it throughout the movie.

The lack of lightspeed jump - pretty ridiculous and really should have had some other techno-babble explanation. It was bad enough in A New Hope, but only lasted 10 minutes or so. Here they actually say it'll take dozens (30?) of hours. 

Music - didn't hear much new here. Of course, the original Empire score blew the doors off of the already fantastic Star Wars music with The Imperial March. Too bad. 

BTW, not sure why new Chewie is thinner and more well groomed that 'real' Chewie. And the new guy doesn't have the jerky quirkieness of the great Peter Mayhew.
