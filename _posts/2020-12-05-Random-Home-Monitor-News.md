My first home computer monitor was a 13" black and white RCA TV which needed a special radio-frequency modulator card to get connected to my Digial Group Z-80-based system. It showed 24 lines of 80 ASCII characters. It cost $90.
Of course, it also could get over-the-air TV signals, very useful for watching Johnny Carson late at night.

About two decades later, I splurged on the state-of-the-art [Silicon Graphics 1600SW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_1600SW), the first wide-screen flat panel display. It had a stunningly sharp, pixel-perfect display, compared the more common CRT displays, and cost $2,000 !!. <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_1600SW#/media/File:SGI1600sw.jpg" style="width:200px">.

I've just bought a monitor for my notebook travel computer (since I'm rarely travelling for work anymore). It's a curved-screen Samsung 24" FHD display. And it cost just over $100.
