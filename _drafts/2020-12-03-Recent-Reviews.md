## Misc Fiction

:+1: Flight Attendant (HBO Max) - just started watching; quirky, murder mystery starring [Kaley Cuoco](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0192505/), a.k.a. Penny from The Big Bang Theory. Recycled plot points, but so far moving along fast and bouyed by good cast.

:+1: Wolf of Snow Hollow (rent on Prime video) - another quirky, absurdist story, this one following a small town cop trying not to believe there's a werewolf prowling around. With a final, nice appearance by the late Robert Forster.

:+1: Queens Gambit (Netflix) - very nice (too pretty?) drama of orphaned girl finding her way in the world as an up-and-coming chess grandmaster. Fun period kitsch and off-kilter characters. A decent amount of fairly accurate chess maneuvering.

## World War IIish

:+1: The 12th Man (Netflix) - true WW2 story of failed commando operation that leaves our hero struggling to survive across frozen ground of northern Norway. Slow, quiet, scenic production. From the intro credits "The most incredible events in this story are the ones that actually took place". And see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baalsrud

:+1: Within The Whirlwind (Prime Video) - realistic drama of life under Stalin - arbitrary accusations and swift injustice followed by the struggle to survive Siberian gulag. Based on true story that's a bit more complicated than presented here ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgenia_Ginzburg ).

## Other Historical

:+1: The Barbarians (Netflix) - decent historical drama of the true story of [Arminius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius), germanic hostage turned Roman Equite turned traitor to Rome and victor of the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest). So far, just one season; probably all I'll need to watch. Endorsed by https://ancientimes.blogspot.com/2020/11/two-thumbs-up-for-german-series.html !
