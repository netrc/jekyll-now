## Grandad's Cars

There's a guy on twitter who will identify olde-type autos in family photos, so I asked him for some help. The first picture is of my Grandad and Grandma in rumble seat somewhere in Florida (Miami?):

And here's a picture of my Grandad's four brothers and three cars. Not sure who belonged to what car or who was the odd-man out, but turns out there's a little history about the gas companies seen in the background. Possibly had some odd connection to the fact that Grandad worked for Sun Oil Company back then (Sunoco now!):
