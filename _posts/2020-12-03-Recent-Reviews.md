## Misc Fiction

:+1: Flight Attendant (HBO Max) - just started watching; quirky, murder mystery starring [Kaley Cuoco](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0192505/), a.k.a. Penny from The Big Bang Theory. Recycled plot points, but so far moving along fast and bouyed by good cast.

:+1: Wolf of Snow Hollow (rent on Prime video) - another quirky, absurdist story, this one following a small town cop trying not to believe there's a werewolf prowling around. With a final, nice appearance by the late Robert Forster.

:+1: Queens Gambit (Netflix) - very nice (too pretty?) drama of orphaned girl finding her way in the world as an up-and-coming chess grandmaster. Fun period kitsch and off-kilter characters. A decent amount of fairly accurate chess maneuvering.

<!--more-->

[7500](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6436726/reference) - not too much here; basically just watching the pilot (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) during an attempted high-jacking. Good news, reasonably deft and over quickly enough - Bad news, never develops any siginificant emotional response in JG-L or us.

## World War IIish

:+1: The 12th Man (Netflix) - true WW2 story of failed commando operation that leaves our hero struggling to survive across frozen ground of northern Norway. Slow, quiet, scenic production. From the intro credits "The most incredible events in this story are the ones that actually took place". And see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baalsrud

:+1: Within The Whirlwind (Prime Video) - realistic drama of life under Stalin - arbitrary accusations and swift injustice followed by the struggle to survive Siberian gulag. Based on true story that's a bit more complicated than presented here ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgenia_Ginzburg ).

:+1: Life & Fate

[Castles In The Sky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3311900/reference) - nice and simple slice of biopic concerning main man and team behind working out of radar in Britain just pre-war-WWII. Hits all the tropes of the genre, and of course elides the truth and makes the men appear much less capable in engineering/science than they must have been. And inevitably skips over the enormous amount of work to turn the device into a functioning military and bureaucratic process to actually gets planes in the sky at the right time and place.

## Other Historical

:+1: The Barbarians (Netflix) - decent historical drama of the true story of [Arminius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius), germanic hostage turned Roman Equite turned traitor to Rome and victor of the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest). So far, just one season; probably all I'll need to watch. Endorsed by https://ancientimes.blogspot.com/2020/11/two-thumbs-up-for-german-series.html !

:+1: Radioactive

:+1::+1: The Good Lord Bird - best thing seen in this list, great performances, quirky (there's that word again), and anchored with Ethan Hawke as out-of-this-world John Brown. Close enough to the truth to pass. Doubly interesting as I recently visited Harper's Ferry, which is a beautiful and tiny riverfront town.
